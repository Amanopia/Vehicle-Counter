# OpenCog

OpenCog is a framework for developing AI systems, especially appropriate for integrative multi-algorithm systems, and artificial general intelligence systems. Though much work remains to be done, it currently contains a functional core framework, and a number of cognitive agents at varying levels of completion, some already displaying interesting and useful functionalities alone and in combination.

The main project site is at [http://opencog.org](http://opencog.org)

# Overview

This git repository contains assorted projects that are central to the OpenCog project, but are not yet mature or stable, and are subject to active development and experimentation. These include:

* An assortment of natural language processing subsystems, including: -- Natural language generation (for expressiong thoughts as sentences). -- Natural language input (for reading and hearing). -- Assorted chatbots, some of which are embodied.
* PLN, a probabilistic reasoning and inference system.
* An embodiment subsystem, attaching language to visual and auditory senses. This is primarily located in the  repository.
